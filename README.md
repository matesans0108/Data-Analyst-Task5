# Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic dataset** to extract insights using statistical and visual exploration.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Overview**
   - Shape, datatypes, missing values.
   - Target variable: `Survived`.

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of Age and Fare.
   - Count plots for Sex, Pclass, Embarked, Survived.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival vs. Sex, Pclass, Age, Fare.
   - Correlation heatmap of numerical features.

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Survival by Pclass & Sex.
   - Impact of FamilySize and Title.

5. **Observations**
   - Females had higher survival rate.
   - Higher-class passengers had better survival.
   - Fare distribution was right-skewed.
   - Large families had lower survival chances.

## Deliverables
- `task5_eda.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code & plots.
- `eda_report.pdf` → Report with summarized insights.
- `train.csv` → Titanic dataset used.
- `README.md` → Explanation + answers to interview questions.
